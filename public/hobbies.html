    <hr/>
<p>If I'm not sitting around working on my computer is pass my time exercising and maintaining/enchancing my physique doing some basic chalestenics and weightlifting.
    But most of my time i go for walks and runs to get my haert pumping.
    I also like to draw and just be creative. Nothing is more fun than create what's on your mind.
    And if I'm not doing 1 of the above I spend my time on youtube watching video's about art, games, self development, documentaries, podcasts and crypto.
    I just love learning new things and right now I'm interested in the web 3.0.
    Last but not least I just like sports in general, There isn't a sport I wouldn't do or try out.
    That's enough about me, now that you had a little glimpse into my life how about you.
    What are your hobbies?
